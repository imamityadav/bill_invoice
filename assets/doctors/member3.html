                Premature ejaculation is an uncontrolled ejaculation wherein the man expels his semen prior or immediately after vaginal penetration with minimal stimulation. Premature Ejaculation (PE) is one of the most commonly found sexual disorders in men. This is found in approximately in 30% of the men. This condition is also called fast ejaculation, quick ejaculation, sheegra patan (seegra patan), shighrapatan, rapid ejaculation, rapid climax etc. Premature Ejaculation is characterized by early ejaculation of the semen before the man experience complete satisfaction. A man with premature ejaculation finds himself guilty for not satisfying his sexual partner.

                <strong>Low Sex Desire(Loss of Libido)</strong><br />
                When the desire for sex is below average it is termed as low sex desire or low sex drive. According to a study, approximately 1 in 5 men suffer from low sex drive at some point of their life. The loss of libido leads to dissatisfaction in opposite partner. Sometimes even the men who are suffering from low libido get frustrated because of this. Age is one of the factors for low sex desire, but not always. Several health disorders like diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety, stress, depression, obesity, drugs, medications and chronic diseases can cause low sex desire in men. Decrease in testosterone hormone level also causes low sex libido. Low sex drive occurs both in men and women. This can cause relationship issues between couples, hence the people who are suffering from low sex drive need to consult the sex therapists immediately.

                Dr Jha's Clinic is one of the best centers for loss of libido treatment in Kanpur. When a patient visits our clinic we understand the exact cause of the problems by asking him/her with the set of questions. Based on the answers and their habits we suggest right medication for them. Our sex clinic is very famous for low sex drive treatment in Kanpur.
